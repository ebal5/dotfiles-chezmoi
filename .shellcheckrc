# ShellCheck configuration file
# This config works for both standalone usage and reviewdog integration

# Use bash dialect by default
shell=bash

# Enable all optional checks
enable=all

# Disable warnings for sourcing files that may not exist
# This is common in dotfiles that source optional configuration
disable=SC1091,SC2250,SC2248,SC2016

# SC2250: Prefer putting braces around variable references
# SC2248: Prefer double quoting even when variables don't contain special characters
# SC2016: Expressions don't expand in single quotes (needed for fzf previews)
# These are style warnings that may be too strict for some use cases

# Format for error reporting (useful for reviewdog integration)
format=tty
